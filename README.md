### Hi there 👋

## Who am I ?
I'm Thibaut Eberhart. I'm a french web developer, with over 8 years of experience in backend development. I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow as a dev.

## What am I currently working on ? 😎
Mostly personal projects, like my own portfolio website, which will help me learn new languages.\
I pretty much finished the backend, but I'm now learning ReactJS to help me with the frontend of the website, to make sure people enjoy what they see.

## What am I currently learning ? 🤔
I'm currently learning ReactJS, through a tutorial series on Youtube. I have a repo with my own version of the code, in case anyone wants to see ! It's the _react-tutorial_ one.
